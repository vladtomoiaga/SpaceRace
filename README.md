It demonstrates:
- How to perform **data cleaning** and **exploration** using **pandas**
- How to visualize data with **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**
- How to extract insights such as the number of launches per organization or the proportion of active vs. retired rockets.

### Built With

The following technologies and libraries are used:

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* ISO3166 (for country code conversions)
